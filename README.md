+ 👋 Hi, I’m @ultr7A
+ 📢 I’m interested in loud buzzing sounds, and simple composable elements.
+ 💞 I'm currently learning to love.
+ 💌 Additionally, learning to react-three-fiber, bash a little bit.. cause that never hurts, and maths and glsl also.

+ 🏗️ Would love to collaborate on anything that makes loud buzzing sounds or uses simple composable elements.

+🎠 Specific sources of fun include Finding weird uses for unicode symbols, WebGL, WebXR, and WebAudio. 
+ 📫 Send funny questions to ultr7a@gmail.com
