+ Hi, I’m @ultr7A 🌙
+ 📢✨ all about loud buzzing sounds, and simple composable elements.
+ 💞 I'm currently learning to love.
+ 🚘 Additionally, learning to "react-three-fiber", and to "bash" a little bit.. cause that never hurts, and maths and glsl also.           
+ 🏗️ Would love to collaborate on anything that makes loud buzzing sounds or uses simple composable elements.
 
+ 🎠  Specific sources of fun include Finding weird uses for unicode symbols, WebGL, WebXR, and WebAudio. 
+ 📫 Send funny questions to ultr7a@gmail.com
